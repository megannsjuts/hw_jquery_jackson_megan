# Comments

After watching the jQuery lectures several times and using the notes in Canvas
as a guide, I actually felt pretty good about this assignment and found that I
worked through it fairly quickly in comparison to past assignments. So I hope that
I did well! I feel like the more that I rewatch the past lectures, the more I am
able to make connections with all that we are learning in this class. I look
forward to receiving feedback on the past couple assignments!
